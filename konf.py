"""
This config class is based on the code found here:
https://github.com/jpf/Twilio-TFA/blob/master/konfig.py

The idea behind it was nice, but we expanded it:

- If ".config" is not found in the current directory, it checks ~/.config
- Instead of storing values in a dictionary, we store it as an attribute of the class itself

This can also be used for plugins to read files and store config settings for plugins.
Though, not heavily advised, due to increased risk of a setting not being set.

If a config setting is already found, it'll be passed over and not stored.

Optional arguments:
conf_file - Config file to look for (default: .config)
defaults - Default settings for any required settings (default: nothing [nothing is required])
